}
```

### Control Endpoints

#### `POST /api/upload_frame`

## üîç Usage Examples

### Viewing the Live Stream
Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/stream` in your web browser to view the live video feed.

### Uploading Frames (Camera Integration)
```python
import requests

# Upload frame with oil spill detection
with open('frame.jpg', 'rb') as f:
    response = requests.post(
        'http://localhost:5000/api/upload_frame',
        data=f.read(),
        headers={
            'X-Camera-Auth': 'your_password',
            'X-Oil-Spill-Detected': 'true',
            'Content-Type': 'image/jpeg'
        }
    )
```

### Checking Detection Status
```python
import requests

response = requests.get('http://localhost:5000/api/status')
status = response.json()
print(f"Oil spill detected: {status['oil_spill_detected']}")
```

## üö® Oil Spill Detection Workflow

1. **Frame Reception**: Camera uploads frames via `/api/upload_frame`
2. **Detection Processing**: External system processes frame and sets detection header
3. **Alert Triggering**: When oil spill detected:
   - Frame is saved to `oil_spill_frames/` directory
   - Event is logged with timestamp
   - Detection status is updated
4. **Notification**: Additional alerting can be added (email, SMS, etc.)

## üîÑ Integration with Camera Systems

The server is designed to work with external camera systems that:
1. Capture video frames
2. Process frames for oil spill detection (using ML/AI models)
3. Upload frames to this server with detection results

## üìä Monitoring and Alerts

### Frame Storage
- Detected oil spill frames are automatically saved
- Files named with timestamp: `oil_spill_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg`
- Stored in `oil_spill_frames/` directory

### Event Logging
- All detection events are logged with full timestamps
- Historical data available via API
- Frame paths included for evidence retrieval

## üöÄ Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
python app.py
```

### Production with Gunicorn
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:5000 app:app
```

### Docker Deployment
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000
CMD ["gunicorn", "-w", "4", "-b", "0.0.0.0:5000", "app:app"]
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No stream available (503)**
   - Ensure frames are being uploaded
   - Check camera authentication
   - Verify stream is started

2. **Unauthorized upload (401)**
   - Check `CAMERA_PASSWORD` environment variable
   - Verify `X-Camera-Auth` header in requests

3. **Invalid image data (400)**
   - Ensure frames are valid JPEG format
   - Check image encoding before upload

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

- Use strong passwords for camera authentication
- Consider HTTPS in production environments
- Implement rate limiting for upload endpoints
- Monitor for unauthorized access attempts
